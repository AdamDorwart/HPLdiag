This directory contains everything that you'll need to run a single
node HPL problem on Comet using 12 MPI processes and 2 threads per
process.

log/			Stores simplified logs of test results
results/		Stores indivudal job stdout/err files
HPL.dat			HPL input data
hpl_1n_12p_2t.run	Slurm batch script
xhpl.hybrid		HPL executable for hybrid (MPI+OpenMP) execution
hosts			List of Comet nodes with partitions
HPLdiag.sh		Runs diagnostics on all nodes in a provided input file (see hosts) and puts the results in log/HPLresults.MMDDYY
HPLcancel.sh		Cancels all running tests for the current $USER. Logs actions in log/HPLresults.MMDDYY
sendStatusEmail.sh	Sends a status email on the health of the system given an input log file (located in logs), uses statusMailingList for recipients
statusEmail.txt		The template used for sendStatusEmail script
statusMailingList	Line deliminated file of emails to send status reports to

To run a diagnostic across all of comet use the provided hosts file like so
$ ./HPLdiag.sh hosts

To run a diagnostic on particular nodes and partitions
$ cat > smallTest
comet-xx-yy compute
comet-ww-zz compute
comet-ii-jj shared

$ ./HPLdiag.sh smallTest

'hosts' file can be generated with
sinfo -o "%n %R" -h | column -t | sort -u -k1,1 > hosts
The end of the file will sometimes contain a line for a 'fat' partition. Remove it as needed.

TODO:
For GPU nodes, use combination of HPL and AMBER
For SSD tests, look into IOR and FIO. Note that drive performance degrades as sectors get marked for TRIM and need to be periodically wiped to achevie full speed
Create Health Moniter cronjob to manage automated benchmarks 
Analyze duration times of results
Better input handling for HPLdiag
- Accept pipping or input file
- Options to run specific tests

Useful commands:
Get the status of all nodes currently enqueued
sinfo -o "%n %T %E" -n `squeue -h -o %n -u $USER | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/,/g'`
Create a hosts retest file from the TIMEOUTs in a result file
grep TIMEOUT log/HPLresults.$timestamp | awk '{print $4}' | grep -f - hosts > retestHosts
