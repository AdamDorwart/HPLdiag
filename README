This directory contains everything that you'll need to run a single
node HPL problem on Comet using 12 MPI processes and 2 threads per
process.

HPL.dat			HPL input data
hpl_1n_12p_2t.run	Slurm batch script
xhpl.hybrid		HPL executable for hybrid (MPI+OpenMP) execution
hosts			List of Comet compute nodes

To run a single problem using first available node
sbatch hpl_1n_12p_2t.run

To run a single problem using a specific node
sbatch -w comet-xx-yy hpl_1n_12p_2t.run
